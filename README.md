# Easy Podcast Feed Creator

This is a (Java) desktop application to create podcast feeds. You can create iTunes podcast feed files and RSS podcast feed files. If you do not enter a date and time in the date field, then the application saves the current timestamp (date, time and timezone). This application that uses JavaFX for the GUI has a modern look.
